## Run_analysis.R
This script performs cleaning and tidying of the dataset as described in the excercise and listed below.
1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
This file assumes that datazip file has been downloaded, unzipped, and read into R.
Please see the CodeBook.md for further definition around the files, variables, and transformations associated with the script.
